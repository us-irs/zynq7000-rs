Zedboard QSPI flasher
============

This application flashes a boot binary generated by the AMD `bootgen` utility from DDR
to the Zedboard QSPI. This project contains a `qspi-flasher.tcl` script which can be invoked
with `xsct` to flash a `boot.bin` and the QSPI flasher to DDR and then run the application.

The main `justfile` provides a convenience runner:

```sh
just flash-nor-zedboard <path to my boot.bin>
```

Please note that `xsct` must be callable for this to be usable.
